## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Modifier keys: Shift (square base), Shift+Alt (cube), Alt (height-only).
- Axis locks for drawing (X/Y/Z).
- Draw/Select tool toggle in the dock.
- Collapsible dock sections for Settings, Presets, and Actions.
- Physics layer presets for baked collision via dock dropdown.
- Live brush count indicator with performance warning colors.
- New SVG icon for LevelRoot in the scene tree.
- Paint Mode: pick an active material and click brushes to apply it in the viewport.
- Active material picker in the dock (resource file dialog for .tres/.material).
- Hover selection highlight (AABB wireframe) when using Select.
- Select tool now yields to built-in gizmos when a brush is already selected.
- Prefab factory for advanced shapes with dynamic shape palette.
- Added wedges, pyramids, prisms, cones, spheres, ellipsoids, capsules, torus, and platonic solids.
- Mesh prefab scaling now respects brush dimensions (capsule/torus/solids).
- Quadrant viewport mode with Top/Front/Side/3D cameras.
- Multi-select (Shift-click), Delete to remove, Ctrl+D to duplicate.
- Nudge selected brushes with arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown.
- Auto-create `LevelRoot` on first click if missing.
- Create Floor button for quick raycast surface setup.
- Pending Subtract cuts with Apply/Clear controls (Bake auto-applies).
- Cylinder brushes, grid snap control, and colored Add/Subtract preview.
- Commit cuts improvements: multi-mesh bake, freeze/restore committed cuts, bake status, bake collision layer control.

### Fixed
- Selection picking now works for cylinders and rotated brushes.
- Height drag direction now matches mouse movement (up = taller).
- Guarded brush deletion to avoid "Remove Node(s)" errors.
- Dock instantiation issues caused by invalid parent paths.
- Commit cuts bake now neutralizes subtract materials so carved faces don't inherit the red preview.

### Documentation
- Added user guide and expanded LevelRoot explanation.
- Updated MVP guide and spec to reflect current workflow.
