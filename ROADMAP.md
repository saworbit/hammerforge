# Roadmap

Last updated: February 15, 2026

This roadmap is a directional plan. Items may change based on user feedback.

## Now
- Numeric input during drag (precise dimensions while drawing or extruding).
- Material atlasing for large scenes.

## Next
- Decals and trim tools.
- Additional bake pipelines (merge strategies, export helpers).

## Later
- Multi-tool presets for common workflows.
- Extended import/export formats.

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Real-time CSG of full scenes.
- Arbitrary mesh editing inside the editor.
