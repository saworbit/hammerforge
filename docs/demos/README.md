# Demo Clips

Last updated: February 15, 2026

Short demo clips make the editor easier to evaluate and keep docs lightweight.

## Clip List (Recommended)
- `demo_draw_extrude.mp4` (15-25s): draw a brush, extrude up, extrude down, undo.
- `demo_cuts_bake.mp4` (15-25s): add + subtract, apply cuts, bake.
- `demo_face_materials_uv.mp4` (20-30s): assign face material, tweak UVs.
- `demo_floor_paint.mp4` (20-30s): paint layer, bucket fill, blend.
- `demo_heightmap.mp4` (20-30s): import heightmap, adjust height scale.
- `demo_export_glb.mp4` (10-15s): bake then export `.glb`.

## Naming Convention
- Use `demo_<topic>_vX.Y.Z.mp4` for versioned clips.
- Keep resolution at 1280x720 or 1920x1080.

## Placement
- Store clips in `docs/demos/`.
- Add links in `README.md` under the Documentation section.
